        <p>This uploader enables you to upload a chromatography data matrix in TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format.
        <p>This file consists of two parts: data section, where each row represents one time point, and each column depicts a sample, and metadata section. First label in the first column of the data section is "DATA". Each row has an identifier in the first column, and each column has an identifier in the first row. Other cells in The data section contain absorbance values for the appropriate time point and sample. The metadata section starts with a header line that contains “METADATA”, “Category”, “Property”, “Unit” and “Value” column labels. All experimental conditions are described in this Metadata section.  See <a href="https://github.com/kbaseIncubator/enigma_metal_campaign/wiki/ChromatographyMatrix-data-type">https://github.com/kbaseIncubator/enigma_metal_campaign/wiki/ChromatographyMatrix-data-type</a> for more information about formatting your chromatography data file.
